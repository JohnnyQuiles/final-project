# My Final Project

In my project, I went with an approach to build a matching game for kids! 

I have my own kids and thought it would be cool idea to create a matching game for them. 
## Features

* **The app features**
* A timer counting down from 60 seconds. 
* A score tracker for matched cards.
* A dance animation when cards and animals match.
* A animal sound plays when cards and animals match.
* Background music playing while kids play the game.
